### Comments

You have to run some kind of web server or a specific app for installing SmartTV apps like SammyWidgets.

On your TV, go to Menu->Smart Features->Samsung Account and type name "develop". 

Then go to SmartHUB, click "More Apps" button, then click "Options" button and choose "IP Setting", put the IP address of your web server and finally choose "Start App Sync" option. Twitch app has to be installed now.

[Stream Channel]
* Stream quality chooser now grays out the quality not yet applied
* Stream info is partrially transparent
* You can see stream title on stream start and every time the title changes (it persists 6 seconds)

For models released before 2013 you might want to use these instructions instead:
From the SmartHUB main screen, click the "Tools" button on the remote. Only from the "Tools" menu, navigate to "Settings", and from there to "Development". (You still have to be logged in as 'develop')
